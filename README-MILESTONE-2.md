# Milestone 2: Integrate pre-compiled ParaLLEl N64 core

Milestone 2 achieved using alternative approach after hitting Emscripten compiler crashes with Mupen64Plus-Next.

## Changes

- Integrated pre-compiled ParaLLEl N64 core from N64Wasm project
- Core files: core.js (250KB) and core.wasm (2.0MB) in public/
- Updated src/main.ts to load emulator core instead of test module
- Core successfully initializes in browser with canvas connected

## Documentation

- Updated TECHNICAL.md with detailed compiler crash troubleshooting
- Documented alternative approach using pre-compiled ParaLLEl core
- Updated ROADMAP.md to reflect M2 completion with alternative path

## Technical Details

- ParaLLEl N64 core compiled with Emscripten 2.0.7
- Successfully loads and initializes Module object with HEAP, FS
- Canvas element properly connected for future rendering
- No JavaScript errors during initialization

## Blockers Resolved

- Emscripten 4.0.18 compiler crashes on main.c (documented)
- Switched from Mupen64Plus-Next to ParaLLEl as MVP approach
- "Motorcycle not car" philosophy - use what works, iterate later

## Console Output
